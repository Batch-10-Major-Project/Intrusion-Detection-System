An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning and the UNSW-NB15 dataset is a project focused on detecting malicious activities within a network. Hereâ€™s an overview of how such a project could be structured:

Project Title:
Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning with UNSW-NB15 Dataset

Project Objective:
To develop a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting and classifying network traffic as normal or malicious, utilizing the UNSW-NB15 dataset for training and testing.

Key Steps in the Project:

1.Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:

KDD Cup  Dataset: A modern dataset with labeled records for normal and malicious network traffic, designed for evaluating IDS models.
Features: The dataset contains 49 features, including protocol, service, flow duration, and statistical metrics.
Classes: Includes both benign traffic and various attack categories (e.g., DoS, fuzzers, backdoors, exploits).
Preprocessing involves:
Handling missing data.
Encoding categorical features.
Normalizing numerical features.
Balancing the dataset if it's imbalanced.

2.Feature Selection/Engineering:

Perform feature selection using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), correlation matrices, or tree-based methods (e.g., feature importance in Random Forests).
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (if necessary).

3.Model Selection:

Use supervised machine learning algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Deep Learning models (e.g., Neural Networks)
Evaluate models using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Area Under Curve (AUC) for ROC

4.Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80:20 split).
Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Fine-tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

5.Deployment:

Convert the trained model into a deployable format (e.g., pickle file).
Integrate with a real-time monitoring system to analyze incoming network traffic.
